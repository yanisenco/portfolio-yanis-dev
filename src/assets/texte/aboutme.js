    "presentation" : ["I am 20 years old and currently studying engineering in St Nazaire. I am sociable, dynamic, and have good listening skills. Being a practitioner of martial arts, these disciplines have instilled in me rigor and respect. Since 2019, I have held the positions of vice president and trainer in a Canoe-Kayak association in Besn√©. This role involves preparing training sessions and ensuring their smooth execution, which has enhanced my ability to communicate effectively with young people and ensure their safety while engaging in leisure activities.","I have been fascinated by IT ever since I was a kid. As for my technical projects, they are described in the following sections if you wish to learn more. I would like to move into a less technical environment, but this experience will give me credibility if I become a manager."]
